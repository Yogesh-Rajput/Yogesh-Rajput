  This project demonstrates a simple yet practical example of data cleaning using Python and pandas library. The dataset contains customer details that are cleaned and preprocessed to prepare for future marketing and analytics applications. A messy dataset is first cleaned and standardized by removing duplicate entries, applying uniform formatting, and handling missing values. The final output is ready to use for CRM integration, visualization and similar tasks.

  #### Technologies used 💻: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

  This project involves exploratory data analysis of Diwali festival sales data. The aim is to analyze customer purchasing behavior during the festive season for gaining insights into marketing, sales, and customer segmentation. The raw sales data is cleaned and preprocessed before using it to analyze customer demographics (age, gender, marital status) and explore purchasing patterns across different regions and product categories. Further analysis is conducted on socio-economic purchasing trends and popular product categories. Finally, visualizations (bar plots, count plots) are created to support the findings.

  #### Technologies used 💻: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
