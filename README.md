## Projects ✨:
- ### Customer Data Cleaning [↗️](https://github.com/Yogesh-Rajput/Customer-List-Data-Cleaning)

  This project demonstrates a simple yet practical example of data cleaning using Python and pandas library. The dataset contains customer details, which are cleaned and preprocessed to prepare for future marketing or analytics applications. A messy dataset was cleaned and standardized by removing duplicate entries, applying uniform formatting to customer data, and handling missing values. The final output could be used for CRM integration, visualization or similar tasks.

  #### Technologies used 💻: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

  This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali festival sales data. The aim is to analyze customer purchasing behavior during the festive season for gaining insights into marketing, sales, and customer segmentation. The raw sales data is cleaned and preprocessed before using it to analyze customer demographics (age, gender, marital status) and explore purchasing patterns across different regions and product categories. Further analysis is conducted on socio-economic purchasing trends and popular product categories. Finally, visualizations (bar plots, count plots) are created to support the findings.

  Visualize insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
